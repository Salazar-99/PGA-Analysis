# PGA Analysis

This is a collection of analyses performed on the complete set of PGA Tour Statistics recorded since statistics tracking began on Tour in 1980. The dataset consists of 442 unique statistics recorded for 2441 unique players over 305 tournaments resulting in about 46 million rows. This data was originally scraped and curated by Brad Klassen (https://github.com/bradklassen).

The directory structure is meant to resemble that recommended by the *Cookiecutter Data Science* project (https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) which aims to provide best practices for the structure of principled data science workflows.
